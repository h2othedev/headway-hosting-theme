## About

Headway Hosting was a start-up business project that I planned back in March 2020. My goal was to take a deep-dive into the web hosting industry and provide enterprise-grade web and professional e-mail hosting services and hosting solutions to businesses ranging from start-ups to enterprises and global businesses at affordable prices.

This package includes a total of 4 views: Homepage, About, Contact, and Services.
